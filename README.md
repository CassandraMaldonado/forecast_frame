# Time Series Analysis & Economic Forecasting

This repository demonstrates practical applications of time series analysis in economics and energy consumption, including ARIMA modeling, regression diagnostics and pattern recognition.

## Notebooks Included

*1. Okuns Law*
This notebook analyzes the relationship between GDP growth and unemployment.

Key Features:
	•	Data cleaning and visualization of unemployment vs. GDP growth.
 
	•	OLS regression with diagnostic testing.
 
	•	Plots and tests for statistical validity.
 
        •	Economic interpretation.

*2. Arima Matrix*
This notebook forecasts a time series using ARIMA modeling, focusing on identifying optimal lag orders and minimizing the error.

Key Features:
	•	AIC matrix heatmap for ARIMA model selection.
	•	Autocorrelation (ACF) and partial autocorrelation (PACF) analysis.
	•	Model fitting and evaluation with RMSE and forecast plots.
	•	Forecasting future time steps with confidence intervals.


*3. Energy Patterns*
This notebook uncovers seasonal and trend patterns in energy consumption data.

Key Features:
	•	Time series decomposition.
	•	Rolling averages and smoothing techniques.
	•	Visual insights into high/low usage months and long-term trends.
	•	Stationarity tests and ADF checks for forecasting readiness.
